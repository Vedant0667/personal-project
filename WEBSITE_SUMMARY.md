# Personal Website - Comprehensive Technical Summary

## Overview
A high-performance Next.js 15 personal portfolio website for college admissions showcasing Vedant Subramanian's journey from age 9 to 17. Features sophisticated scroll-based animations, server-first architecture, and seamless crossfading photo transitions.

## Architecture & Performance
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Server-First Design**: Most components are server components, client components only where interactivity is needed
- **Motion Isolation**: Custom Motion wrapper components that respect reduced motion preferences
- **Dynamic Imports**: Heavy components (Timeline, Lightbox) loaded with code splitting
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with AVIF/WebP formats, proper sizes, blur placeholders
- **Scroll Management**: Custom scroll restoration control ensures page always loads at top
- **Full-Screen Hero**: Precise spacing ensures hero section fills entire viewport on initial load

## Sections & Features

### 1. Navigation (NavBar.tsx)
- Sticky navigation with backdrop blur
- Smooth scroll links to sections (Timeline, Projects, Recognition, Contact)
- **VS Logo**: Custom click handler that smoothly scrolls to absolute top of page
- Animated on scroll with translateY and opacity transforms
- Email CTA button with gradient styling
- **Scroll Management**: Prevents browser scroll restoration, always starts at top

### 2. Hero Section (Hero.tsx)
- **Full Viewport Design**: Precisely spaced to fill entire screen on initial load
- Animated headshot with ring border and shadow
- Gradient text treatment for name
- Staggered text animations using Reveal components
- Decorative floating gradient orbs with blur effects
- Professional tagline and CTA button
- Section ID "home" for navigation targeting

### 3. Interactive Timeline (Timeline.tsx) - **SIGNATURE FEATURE**
**Note**: The About section was removed; Timeline now directly follows Hero section
**The most sophisticated section with scroll-synchronized animations:**

#### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// Scroll progress tracking
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({
  target: containerRef,
  offset: ["start center", "end center"],
});

// Age/year number updates
const currentAge = useTransform(
  scrollYProgress,
  [0.2, 0.33, 0.5, 0.66, 0.83, 1],
  [9,    12,   14,  14,  17,   17],
  { clamp: true }
);

// Overlapping photo crossfades
const age9Opacity = useTransform(
  scrollYProgress,
  [0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5],
  [0, 1,   1,    0]
);
```

#### Visual Effects:
- **Seamless Face Morphing**: Three photos (age 9, 14, 17) with perfectly overlapping crossfades
  - Age 9 photo: Opacity transitions [0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5] → [0, 1, 1, 0]
  - Age 14 photo: Opacity transitions [0.2, 0.5, 0.5, 0.83] → [0, 1, 1, 0] 
  - Age 17 photo: Opacity transitions [0.5, 0.83, 1] → [0, 1, 1]
- **Synchronized Numbers**: Age and year display fades in with first photo (0 to 0.2), updates as user scrolls
- **Reveal Animations**: Header and timeline cards use staggered Reveal animations (0.1s delays)
- **Progress Path**: Animated vertical line that fills as user progresses
- **Sticky Panel**: Photo panel stays in view while timeline cards scroll past
- **Milestone Dots**: Color-coded dots matching each journey point
- **Hover Effects**: Cards have subtle shadow transitions on hover

#### Content Journey:
1. **Age 9 (2017)**: First YouTube Channel - guitar tutorials with iPad mini
2. **Age 12 (2020)**: Business Inspiration - learning from dad's leadership
3. **Age 14 (2022)**: Shelter Aid TX nonprofit founding
4. **Age 14 (2022)**: Rally school attendance app (50%+ adoption)
5. **Age 17 (2025)**: THIɅK Clear memory-aid glasses at UPenn M&TSI
6. **Age 17 (2025)**: CampusLife app + 700k+ content views

### 4. Projects Section (Projects.tsx)

  - Bullet points for key features

### 5. Achievements Section (Achievements.tsx + AchievementsList.tsx)
- **Server/Client Split**: Server component imports data, client component handles animations
- **Staggered Grid Animations**: Cards appear with spring physics
- **Dynamic Color Schemes**: 4 rotating color palettes for visual variety
- **3D Hover Effects**: Cards rotate and scale on hover with perspective transforms
- **Content**: Awards, recognitions, competition results, certifications

### 6. Contact Section (Contact.tsx)
- Animated contact form with Motion components
- Email integration and social links
- Reveal animations for form elements

## Custom Motion System
**Location**: `src/components/motion/Motion.tsx`

### Accessibility-First Approach:
```typescript
export function useReducedMotionSafe() {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();
  return shouldReduceMotion ?? false;
}

export const MBox = forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, DivMotionProps>(
  function MBox(props, ref) {
    const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotionSafe();
    
    if (shouldReduceMotion) {
      // Render static div when motion is reduced
      const { animate, initial, whileHover, whileTap, variants, transition, ...staticProps } = props;
      return <div ref={ref} {...staticProps} />;
    }
    
    return <motion.div ref={ref} {...props} />;
  }
);
```

### Available Components:
- `MBox` (div), `MSection`, `MSpan`, `MLink`, `MArticle`, `MH1`, `MP`, `MNav`, `MLi`, `MUl`
- All strip motion props when reduced motion is preferred
- Proper TypeScript integration with HTML attributes

## Reveal Animation System
**Component**: `src/components/Reveal.tsx`
- Intersection Observer-based animations
- Configurable delay and once-only options
- Spring physics with customizable stiffness/damping
- Default animation: opacity + translateY + scale

```typescript
const variants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 48, scale: 0.98 },
  show: {
    opacity: 1, y: 0, scale: 1,
    transition: { type: "spring", stiffness: 120, damping: 18, delay },
  },
};
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting:
```typescript
// Dynamic import for heavy Timeline component
const ClientTimelineWrapper = dynamic(() => import("@/components/ClientTimelineWrapper"), {
  ssr: false,
});
```

### Image Optimization:
```typescript
// Next.js Image with optimization
<Image
  src={imageSrc}
  alt={imageAlt}
  fill
  className="object-cover"
  sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 520px, (min-width: 640px) 50vw, 100vw"
  priority={false}
/>
```

### Memoization:
- `ProjectCard` wrapped in `React.memo`
- Animation variants hoisted to avoid inline objects
- Callback memoization for event handlers

## Styling & Design System
- **Primary Colors**: Amber/Orange gradient theme (#f59e0b, #ef4444)
- **Background**: Warm cream (#FFFBEB) with subtle dot pattern
- **Typography**: Custom font stack with display, mono, and body fonts
- **Cards**: Consistent rounded corners, subtle shadows, warm backgrounds
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with sm/md/lg breakpoints

## Configuration
**Next.js Config** (`next.config.ts`):
```typescript
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  images: {
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
  },
  experimental: {
    optimizePackageImports: ['framer-motion'],
  },
};
```

## Key Technical Innovations

### 1. Perfect Crossfade Synchronization
The Timeline's photo transitions use perfectly overlapping scroll ranges for fade-out/fade-in, creating seamless face morphing that demonstrates technical sophistication. Each transition starts exactly when the previous ends.

### 2. Server-First Architecture
Most components render on server, with client-side hydration only where needed, improving performance and SEO.

### 3. Accessibility-First Animations
All animations respect user's motion preferences, gracefully degrading to static versions.

### 4. Performance-Optimized Bundle
Strategic dynamic imports, image optimization, and framer-motion tree-shaking keep bundle size minimal.

### 5. Custom Scroll Management
- ScrollReset component disables browser scroll restoration
- Ensures consistent top-of-page loading experience
- VS logo navigation uses programmatic smooth scrolling to absolute top
